      <h1>Design Issues of Distributed System</h1>
    </header>
    <main class="text">
      <h2>Heterogeneity</h2>
      <p>
        Heterogeneity is applied to the network, computer hardware, operating
        system, and implementation of different developers. A key component of
        the heterogeneous distributed system client-server environment is
        middleware. Middleware is a set of services that enables applications
        and end-user to interact with each other across a heterogeneous
        distributed system.
      </p>
      <h2>openness</h2>
      <p>
        The openness of the distributed system is determined primarily by the
        degree to which new resource-sharing services can be made available to
        the users. Open systems are characterized by the fact that their key
        interfaces are published. It is based on a uniform communication
        mechanism and published interface for access to shared resources. It can
        be constructed from heterogeneous hardware and software.
      </p>
      <h2>scalability</h2>
      <p>
        The scalability of the system should remain efficient even with a
        significant increase in <span class="s">i am here</span>the number of users and resources connected. It
        shouldn’t matter if a program has 10 or 100 nodes; performance shouldn’t
        vary. A distributed system’s scaling requires consideration of a number
        of elements, including size, geography, and management.
      </p>
      <h2>security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of an information system has three components
        Confidentially, integrity, and availability. Encryption protects shared
        resources and keeps sensitive information secrets when transmitted.
      </p>
      <h2>concurrency</h2>
      <p>
        There is a possibility that several clients will attempt to access a
        shared resource at the same time. Multiple users make requests on the
        same resources, i.e. read, write, and update. Each resource must be safe
        in a concurrent environment. Any object that represents a shared
        resource in a distributed system must ensure that it operates correctly
        in a concurrent environment.
